== Attr
* main memory(store user program: coe and data)
* registers(CPU registers)
* TLB
* page table

== Methods

static void CheckEndian()::
* Assertion
+
[WARNING]
====
Code should be compiled with same endianess as host 
====

Machine(bool debug)::
* Initialize:
** registers
** main memory
** TLB(is used i,e, on __USE_TLB__)
** debug options
* Check Endianess

~Machine()::
* delete main memory
* delete TLB is initialized

void RaiseException(ExceptionType which, int badVAddr)::
* store virtual address that caused the exception
+
[NOTE]
====
This could be needed to retry the instruction after execption is handled, for example like in page fault
====
* Complete any on-going stuff
* set system to kernel mode
* Call execption handler by passing the 'which' of the exeception
* set system back to user mode

void Debugger()::
* interrupt dumpstate
* machine dumpstate
* print totalTicks
* execute actions related to character entered on console:
** <return>: execute one instruction
** <number>: until timerTick = <number>
** c: until completion
** ?: print the help options


void DumpState()::
* prints out:
** machine registers:
*** GPR
*** stack
*** ret address reg

int ReadRegister(int num)::
* Assertion:
+
[WARNING]
====
Number of register should be within range[0,39]
====
* Return registers[num]

void WriteRegister(int num, int value)::
* Assertion:
+
[WARNING]
====
Number of register should be within range[0,39]
====
* set registers[num] = value
