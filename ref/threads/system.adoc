void Initialize (int argc, char **argv)::
* Parse all flags and configure flags for os and debug options
* Initialize debug
* create objects:
** stats <- Statistics() (stats.cc in machine)
** interrupt <- Interrupt() (interrupt.cc in machine)
** scheduler
** timer
** thread
* set thread status to Running
* enable interrupt
* Set *Cleanup* as user abort handler
+
[NOTE]
====
Whenever user presses ctrl-c on shell, *SIGINT* signal is sent to the program, using linux apis we can register an handler which will be triggered on this signal to do the needful.
====
* create objects:
+
.Object and their conditional compilation flag
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Object name | Macro required to compile
| machine, synchconsole | __USER_PROGRAM__ 
| synchDisk | __FILESYS__ 
| fileSystem | __FILESYS_NEEDED__
| postOffice | __NETWORK__
|====================


void Cleanup()::
* delete the following objects if they are declared during conditional compilation
** Conditionally compiled
+
.Object and their conditional compilation flag
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Object name | Macro required to compile
| postOffice | __NETWORK__
| machine | __USER_PROGRAM__ 
| fileSystem | __FILESYS_NEEDED__
| synchDisk | __FILESYS__ 
|====================
** Always compiled:
*** timer
*** scheduler
*** interrupt
* Exit(0)(goto sysdep.cc in machine folder)
