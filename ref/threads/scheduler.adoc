= Scheduler

== Attr
readList -> queue of threads in ready state


== Methods

Scheduler()::
* create a readyList

~Scheduler()::
* delete the readyList

void ReadyToRun (Thread * thread)::
* set thread status to ready
* append (add it to back) to ready queue

Thread * FindNextToRun ()::
* a ready thread is removed from the front of ready queue

void Print ()::
* print name of all threads in ready queue

void Run (Thread * nextThread)::
+
[NOTE]
====
To prempt current thread and run new thread
====
* Assertion:
+
[WARNING]
====
Interrupt should be off
====
* On __USER_PROGRAM__:
** If currentThread is a user space program:
*** Save user mode CPU registers
+
[NOTE]
====
a user program thread has *two* sets of CPU registers: 

* for state while executing user code, 
* for state while executing kernel code.

Here whatever is saved is user code CPU registers
====
*** Save user mode address space state
+
[NOTE]
====
This need not be just register information, it can be anything
====
* Abort if there's stack overflow of current thread
* set new thread status as Running
* do switch from old thread to new thread(refer SWITCH in threads/switch)
+
[NOTE]
====
When CPU is given up voluntarily using yield or when a thread finishes, in both cases if there's another thread to run, SWITCH is called
====

* do cleanup if there's a threadToBeDestroyed
+
[NOTE]
====
If CPU is given up voluntarily via yield no thread is set as threadToBeDestroyed 
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This cleanup action is in 2 places in code:

* setting up new thread
* after switch in this api

We need to understand what are the cases that will cause old thread to be cleaned up here or there.
====

* On USER_PROGRAM:
** If currentThread is a user space program:

*** Restore user mode CPU registers
*** Restore user mode address space state
