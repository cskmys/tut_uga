= start

This code is in assembly(.S file)

Any user program that's compiled is linked with this .S file

This contains the startup code that calls jump to main function in user program.

This file contains all the assembly code to raise a syscall exception on the MIPS simulator from the user program.

Whenever a 'syscall' is made from user program, the code in this file is run.

Refer test/halt for more information

Currently the available syscalls to user programs are:

* Halt
* Exit
* Exec
* Join
* Create
* Open
* Read
* Write
* Close
* Fork
* Yield

[WARNING]
====
As of now only Halt is implemented. Calling any other syscall with cause nachos to abort.
