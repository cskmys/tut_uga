* entry point of OS is threads/main.cc

* Files to read first:
** threads/main.cc
** threads/thread.cc
** threads/thread.h

* Question to ponder upon:
* How is kernel thread created?
* Where does stack and registers for Kernel thread come from?
* What role do the data structure allocated by: 
+
----
currentThread = new Thread("main")
----
play?
* Can subsequent kernel threads be created in same way?
